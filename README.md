# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game in Java

Developed using the IntelliJ IDE.

You will need a suitable IDE and a development environment to allow you to build applications using Java. I have used IntelliJ however you can use different IDEs as long as they have a suitable development kit to run Java programs.

Below are the steps to download and run the program using IntelliJ:

1.	Download the IDE for your OS....https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html#section=windows and the Java JDK from here..http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
2.	Make sure to click the "download and install JRE x86 by JetBrains" while installing for the Java Runtime Environment.
3.	Download the files in the Minesweeper folder and place it in the directory C:\Users\your name\IdeaProjects. If the IdeaProjects folder doesn't exist then create one. Run the file Psyrp2Main.
4.	You should receive a message on the top saying "Project SDK is not defined". Click "Setup SDK" then "Configure".
5.	Press the plus arrow on the top left hand corner and click "JDK". Locate where you have downloaded the Java JDK in your home directory and then press on the "jdk- 10.0.2" folder then press "OK". Then press "OK" again to configure the SDK.
6.	On the top-right of the IDE, click "project structure" than modules underneath project settings. If there is already a content root, then remove it. Press on "add content root" and click on "Minesweeper" then "OK".
7.	Under the project tab, select the project compiler output as the "out" folder (C:\Users\your name\IdeaProjects\Minesweeper\out) Then press "Apply" and "OK".
8.	Also on the top-right of the IDE next to the hammer icon, click "add configurations" then press the plus icon and click on "application".
9.	For the main class, click on "Psyrp2Main" on the pop up window then "OK". For the use classpath of module, click on "Minesweeper" then press "Apply" and "OK".
10.	Finally, press the hammer icon to build the program then run it.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have a problem with setting up/running the program for whichever IDE. I would be more than happy to help.
